# Spec-Driven

Specification-driven development workflow for Claude Code with persistent artifacts.

> **Part of [claude-code-plugins](https://github.com/adeonir/claude-code-plugins)** - A curated marketplace of Claude Code plugins for feature development, debugging, frontend generation, and git helpers.

## Features

- Structured specification creation from descriptions or PRDs
- Codebase exploration and pattern analysis
- Technical planning with decisive architectural choices
- **Critical files consolidation** (reference patterns, files to modify/create)
- Task decomposition with dependency tracking
- Granular implementation (single task, range, or all)
- **Context-aware implementation** with spec validation and reference files
- Confidence-based code review with **acceptance criteria validation**
- Semantic code operations via Serena MCP

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - Anthropic's official CLI for Claude
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Required by Serena MCP for semantic code operations

### Add Marketplace

First, add the marketplace to Claude Code (only needed once):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add adeonir/claude-code-plugins
```

### Install Plugin

```bash
/plugin install spec-driven
```

This command automatically:
- Downloads the plugin from the marketplace
- Configures Serena MCP for semantic code operations
- Makes all commands available in your Claude Code session

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create specification
claude /spec "Add user authentication with OAuth"

# 2. Resolve any ambiguities
claude /clarify

# 3. Generate technical plan
claude /plan

# 4. Create task list
claude /tasks

# 5. Implement tasks
claude /implement             # Next pending task
claude /implement T001        # Single task
claude /implement T001-T005   # Range
claude /implement --all       # All pending

# 6. Review and summarize
claude /review
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/spec <description>` | Create feature specification |
| `/clarify` | Resolve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items |
| `/plan` | Explore codebase and create technical plan |
| `/tasks` | Generate task list from plan |
| `/implement [scope]` | Execute implementation tasks |
| `/review` | Review code and summarize work |

## Artifacts

All artifacts are stored in `.specs/{branch}/`:

```
.specs/
└── feature-auth/
    ├── spec.md      # Requirements and acceptance criteria
    ├── research.md  # External research findings (if needed)
    ├── plan.md      # Technical architecture and critical files
    └── tasks.md     # Trackable task list with artifact refs
```

## Task Markers

Tasks use markers to indicate parallelization:

```markdown
- [ ] T001 [P] Setup auth provider        # Parallel-safe
- [ ] T002 [P] Create user schema         # Parallel-safe
- [ ] T003 [B:T001,T002] Implement login  # Blocked by T001 and T002
- [ ] T004 [B:T003] Add error handling    # Blocked by T003
```

## Workflow

```
/spec --> /clarify --> /plan --> /tasks --> /implement --> /review
  |          |           |          |            |            |
  v          v           v          v            v            v
spec.md   spec.md    research.md  tasks.md   code +       AC status
          (updated)  + plan.md               tasks.md    + summary
```

Each phase reads previous artifacts to maintain context:
- `/implement` reads spec (AC), plan (critical files), and research
- `/review` validates acceptance criteria and architecture decisions

## Serena MCP Integration

This plugin uses [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) for semantic code operations:

| Phase | Tool | Benefit |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/plan` | `find_symbol` | Precise symbol location |
| `/plan` | `find_referencing_symbols` | Impact analysis |
| `/implement` | `insert_after_symbol` | Semantic edits |

Serena MCP is auto-configured via `.mcp.json` when you install the plugin.
